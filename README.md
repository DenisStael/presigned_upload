# PresignedUpload

Gem designed to control file uploads via presigned URLs to cloud storage services.

A presigned URL is generated by a server that grants temporary and controlled access to a specific resource. In the context of file uploads, it allows clients to directly upload files to a designated storage location without the server being directly involved in the transfer process.

## Installation

Add this to your Gemfile and run `bundle install`.

```ruby
gem 'presigned_upload'
```

Or install it yourself as:
```sh
gem install presigned_upload
```
